# Aspra ‚Äì Voice-Based AI Scheduling Assistant

**Aspra** is a conversational voice agent built to schedule meetings in a natural, human-like way through real-time conversation. Using Vapi.ai, GPT-4o, n8n, and Google Calendar API, it handles multi-turn interactions, understands vague inputs, checks for availability, and confirms bookings ‚Äî all over voice.

This project was submitted as part of the **NextDimension Take-Home Assignment** focused on intelligent voice agent design, LLM reasoning, and external tool integration.

##  Tech Stack

| Component | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Voice Interface | [Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) |
| LLM | GPT-4o (via Vapi) |
| Orchestration | [n8n](https://n8n.io) |
| Calendar API | Google Calendar API |
| Internal Agent | AI Agent Node in n8n (uses Gemini / GPT-like logic) |
| Integration | Webhook between Vapi and n8n |

## Features

- Multi-turn conversation over voice
- Understands vague & relative inputs like ‚Äúafter lunch‚Äù, ‚Äúnext Tuesday‚Äù
- Calls tools only after all required info is confirmed
- Live availability checking via `getAvailability`
- Slot confirmation and booking via `BookAppointment`
- Voice UX optimized for tone, pauses, and human phrasing
- Works via both browser and phone call

##  Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

###  **Latency vs Natural Tone**
- Used short, casual phrases ("Alright... lemme check") to improve naturalness.
- Chose to **sacrifice a few hundred ms of latency** for richer voice response using ellipses (`...`) and filler words.
- Avoided robotic phrasing with smart chunking like:  
  _‚ÄúOkay... I found two slots. 2 PM and 4:30 PM.‚Äù_

### **Workflow Design: Split vs Aggregate**
- Split logic in n8n into:
  - Webhook collection
  - Calendar API free/busy check
  - Formatting response with `Set` node
- Aggregated slot options and returned them to Vapi in structured JSON (for TTS to read out clearly).

###  **Using Gemini for Reasoning Inside n8n**
- In one version of the workflow, used the AI Agent node (Gemini-style) inside n8n to:
  - Parse vague time inputs
  - Validate intent
  - Smooth out edge-case corrections (e.g. ‚Äúactually, make it 45 minutes instead‚Äù)

---

##  Bugs & Challenges

###  Tool Calls Not Triggering (Early)
- Initially, `getAvailability` was triggered **before all inputs were collected**.
- Solved by updating the system prompt to delay tool call until all three (duration, day, time) were explicitly confirmed.

###  Webhook Misfires
- Faced **multiple executions** from webhook due to auto-responses being interpreted as final answers.
- Resolved using state-based checks inside the n8n flow.

### üéô Flat Voice Output
- The voice (Sarah) felt robotic.
- Since I couldn‚Äôt access ElevenLabs' "Rachel", I added ellipses and natural filler in TTS responses to simulate **human pauses**.

## Sample Conversation

Aspra: Hey! I‚Äôm Aspra. How can I help you today?
User: I wanna book a meeting next Monday
Aspra: Cool. How long should it be?
User: Just half an hour
Aspra: Got it. Morning, afternoon, or later?
User: Afternoon would be perfect
Aspra: Alright... lemme check what‚Äôs open.

(getAvailability tool call runs via webhook)

Aspra: Okay, 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM are free. Which one sounds better?
User: Let‚Äôs go with 2
Aspra: You‚Äôre all set for 2 PM next Monday!
## Final Thoughts

Building *Aspra* helped me deeply understand how to blend:
- LLM-based reasoning with structured workflow tools (n8n)
- Tool-calling flow control
- UX challenges in real-time voice interaction
- Latency vs natural voice tradeoffs
